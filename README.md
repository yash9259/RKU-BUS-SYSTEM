RKU-BUS-SYSTEM
Our group has created a University Bus management app project for our final exam submission of Android.
We have created this app for the use of University students as well as faculties, 
who are travelling through University Transport. Our app is helpful for them in many ways,
such as they can view the stops that are covered on their specific route,
they can also see the approximate timing the bus takes between two stops on a specific route,
they can also have a map view of thier bus route, there is also a emergency calling service where in case of any mis-happening, 
the user can directly contact the highest responsible autority. We are also planning to add live location tracking in our future enhancement,
where users can get the live location of the bus they want to see. Here the Login credentials will be given by the university itself,
so the missuse of this app could be reduced.
